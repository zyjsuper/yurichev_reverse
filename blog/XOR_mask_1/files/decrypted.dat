Never share a foxhole with anyone braver than you are.                        2                                                                                Murphy's Military Laws:                                                          2. No battle plan ever survives contact with the enemy.                          2                                                                                Murphy's Military Laws:                                                          3. Friendly fire ain't.                                                          3                                                                                Murphy's Military Laws:                                                          4. The most dangerous thing in the combat zone                                      is an officer with a map.                                                     3                                                                                Murphy's Military Laws:                                                          5. The problem with taking the easy way out is                                      that the enemy has already mined it.                                          3                                                                                Murphy's Military Laws:                                                          6. The buddy system is essential to your survival;                                  it gives the enemy somebody else to shoot at.                                 3                                                                                Murphy's Military Laws:                                                          7. The further you are in advance of your own positions,                            the more likely your artillery will shoot short.                              2                                                                                Murphy's Military Laws:                                                          8. Incoming fire has the right of way.                                           2                                                                                Murphy's Military Laws:                                                          9. If your advance is going well, you are walking into an ambush.                2                                                                                Murphy's Military Laws:                                                          10. The quartermaster has only two sizes, too large and too small.               2                                                                                Murphy's Military Laws:                                                          11. If you really need an officer in a hurry, take a nap.                        3                                                                                Murphy's Miltary Laws:                                                           12. The only time suppressive fire works is when it is used                          on abandoned positions.                                                      3                                                                                Murphy's Military Laws:                                                          13. The only thing more accurate than incoming enemy fire                            is incoming friendly fire.                                                   3                                                                                Murphy's Military Laws:                                                          14. There is nothing more satisfying that having someone take                        a shot at you, and miss.                                                     3                                                                                Murphy's Military Laws:                                                          15. Don't be conspicuous. In the combat zone, it draws fire.                         Out of the combat zone, it draws sergeants.                                  2                                                                                Murphy's Military Laws:                                                          16. If your sergeant can see you, so can the enemy.                              2                                                                                Conrad's Conundrum:                                                              Technologie don't transfer.                                                      3                                                                                Blessed are the young, for they shall inherit                                    the national debt.

Hitting a tree is simply bad luck and has no place in a scientific               game.  The player should estimate the distance the ball would have               traveled if it had not hit the tree and play the ball from there,                preferably atop a nice firm tuft of grass.                                                       -- Donald A.

Such veering right or left frequently results            from friction between the face of the club and the cover of the ball             and the player should not be penalized for the erratic behavior of the           ball resulting from such uncontrollable physical                                 phenomena.                                                                                       -- Donald A.

Benchmarks on this technique are promising; tremendous           amounts of nothing can be produced in this manner.  Certain hardware             limitations can limit the speed of this method, especially in the                larger systems which require a more involved & less efficient                    power-down sequence.                                                                     An alternate approach is to pull the main breaker for the                building, which seems to provide even more nothing, but in truth has             bugs in it, since it usually inhibits the systems which keep the beer            cool.                                                                            1                                                                                A nuclear war can ruin your whole day.                                           2                                                                                A pedestal is as much a prison as any small, confined space.                                     -- Gloria Steinem                                                1                                                                                A penny saved is ridiculous.                                                     1                                                                                A person is just about as big as the things that make them angry.                2                                                                                A physicist is an atom's way of knowing about atoms.                                             -- George Wald                                                   10                                                                               A pig is a jolly companion,                                                      Boar, sow, barrow, or gilt --                                                    A pig is a pal, who'll boost your morale,                                        Though mountains may topple and tilt.

For example, in Year 1 that useless letter "c" would be dropped          to be replased either by "k" or "s", and likewise "x" would no longer            be part of the alphabet.  The only kase in which "c" would be retained           would be the "ch" formation, which will be dealt with later.  Year 2             might reform "w" spelling, so that "which" and "one" would take the              same konsonant, wile Year 3 might well abolish "y" replasing it with             "i" and Iear 4 might fiks the "g/j" anomali wonse and for all.

As a method of sending a missile to the higher, and even to the highest          parts of the earth's atmospheric envelope, Professor Goddard's rocket            is a practicable and therefore promising device.  It is when one                 considers the multiple-charge rocket as a traveler to the moon that one          begins to doubt ... for after the rocket quits our air and really                starts on its journey, its flight would be neither accelerated nor               maintained by the explosion of the charges it then might have left.              Professor Goddard, with his "chair" in Clark College and countenancing           of the Smithsonian Institution, does not know the relation of action to          re-action, and of the need to have something better than a vacuum                against which to react ...

For example, in 1780 Luigi               Galvani discovered (this is the truth) that when he attached two                 different kinds of metal to the leg of a frog, an electrical current             developed and the frog's leg kicked, even though it was no longer                attached to the frog, which was dead anyway.  Galvani's discovery led            to enormous advances in the field of amphibian medicine.  Today,                 skilled veterinary surgeons can take a frog that has been seriously              injured or killed, implant pieces of metal in its muscles, and watch it          hop back into the pond just like a normal frog, except for the fact              that it sinks like a stone.                                                                      -- Dave Barry, "What is Electricity?"                            5                                                                                After a few boring years, socially meaningful rock 'n' roll died out.

Then along came the first Electrical Pioneer,                  Benjamin Franklin, who flew a kite in a lighting storm and received a            serious electrical shock.  This proved that lighting was powered by the          same force as carpets, but it also damaged Franklin's brain so severely          that he started speaking only in incomprehensible maxims, such as "A             penny saved is a penny earned."  Eventually he had to be given a job             running the post office.                                                                         -- Dave Barry, "What is Electricity?"                            12                                                                               Although written many years ago, Lady Chatterley's Lover has just been           reissued by the Grove Press, and this pictorial account of the                   day-to-day life of an English gamekeeper is full of considerable                 interest to outdoor minded readers, as it contains many passages on              pheasant-raising, the apprehending of poachers, ways to control vermin,          and other chores and duties of the professional gamekeeper.

He              knows he doesn't know what he's doing, so he does it carefully and with          great restraint.                                                                         As he designs the first work, frill after frill and                      embellishment after embellishment occur to him.  These get stored away           to be used "next time".  Sooner or later the first system is finished,           and the architect, with firm confidence and a demonstrated mastery of            that class of systems, is ready to build a second system.                                This second is the most dangerous system a man ever designs.             When he does his third and later ones, his prior experiences will                confirm each other as to the general characteristics of such systems,            and their differences will identify those parts of his experience that           are particular and not generalizable.                                                    The general tendency is to over-design the second system, using          all the ideas and frills that were cautiously sidetracked on the first           one.

One             approach is to undergo a painful surgical procedure wherein your skin            is turned inside-out, so the young cells are on the outside, but then            of course you have the unpleasant side effect that your insides                  gradually fill up with dead old cells and you explode.  So this                  procedure is pretty much limited to top Hollywood stars for whom                 youthful beauty is a career necessity, such as Elizabeth Taylor and              Orson Welles.                                                                                    -- Dave Barry, "Saving Face"                                     2                                                                                "...and the fully armed nuclear warheads, are, of course, merely a               courtesy detail."                                                                6                                                                                And this is a table ma'am.

[In fact, this was the big breakthrough for the          Wright Brothers.  They were watching birds one day, trying to figure             out how to get their crude machine to fly, when suddenly it dawned on            Wilbur.  "Orville," he said, "all we have to do is remove the sexual             organs!"  You should have seen their original design.]  As a result,             birds are very, very difficult to arouse sexually.  You almost never             see an aroused bird.  So when they want to reproduce, birds fly up and           stand on telephone lines, where they monitor telephone conversations             with their feet.  When they find a conversation in which people are              talking dirty, they grip the line very tightly until they are both               highly aroused, at which point the female gets pregnant.                                         -- Dave Barry, "Sex and the Single Amoeba: What Every                               Teen Should Know"                                             8                                                                                As you reach for the web, a venomous spider appears.  Unable to pull             your hand away in time, the spider promptly, but politely, bites you.            The venom takes affect quickly causing your lips to turn plaid along             with your complexion.  You become dazed, and in your stupor you fall             from the limbs of the tree.  Snap!  Your head falls off and rolls all            over the ground.  The instant before you croak, you hear the whoosh of           a vacuum being filled by the air surrounding your head.  Worse yet, the          spider is suing you for damages.                                                 1                                                                                As Zeus said to Narcissus, "Watch yourself."                                     1                                                                                ASHes to ASHes, DOS to DOS.                                                      3                                                                                Ask five economists and you'll get five different explanations (six if           one went to Harvard).                                                                            -- Edgar R.

The judges' decisions based          on it were sound in logic and in law.  Nothing in any existing court             was ever more thoroughly proved than the charges of witchcraft and               sorcery for which so many suffered death.  If there were no witches,             human testimony and human reason are alike destitute of value.                                   -- Ambrose Bierce, "The Devil's Dictionary"                      2                                                                                "But don't you worry, its for a cause -- feeding global corporations             paws."                                                                           1                                                                                "But I don't like Spam!!!!"                                                      10                                                                               ... But if we laugh with derision, we will never understand.  Human              intellectual capacity has not altered for thousands of years so far as           we can tell.  If intelligent people invested intense energy in issues            that now seem foolish to us, then the failure lies in our understanding          of their world, not in their distorted perceptions.  Even the standard           example of ancient nonsense -- the debate about angels on pinheads --            makes sense once you realize that theologians were not discussing                whether five or eighteen would fit, but whether a pin could house a              finite or an infinite number.                                                                    -- S.

Edison's first major invention in            1877, was the phonograph, which could soon be found in thousands of              American homes, where it basically sat until 1923, when the record was           invented.  But Edison's greatest achievement came in 1879, when he               invented the electric company.  Edison's design was a brilliant                  adaptation of the simple electrical circuit: the electric company sends          electricity through a wire to a customer, then immediately gets the              electricity back through another wire, then (this is the brilliant               part) sends it right back to the customer again.                                 .                                                                                This means that an electric company can sell a customer the same batch           of electricity thousands of times a day and never get caught, since              very few customers take the time to examine their electricity closely.           In fact the last year any new electricity was generated in the United            States was 1937; the electric companies have been merely re-selling it           ever since, which is why they have so much free time to apply for rate           increases.                                                                                       -- Dave Barry, "What is Electricity?"                            6                                                                                "But this has taken us far afield from interface, which is not a bad             place to be, since I particularly want to move ahead to the kludge.

A true              story:  One Bob Sjoberg, new at the MIT AI Lab, expressed some                   annoyance at the use of jargon.  Over his loud objections, we made a             point of using jargon as much as possible in his presence, and                   eventually it began to sink in.  Finally, in one conversation, he used           the word "canonical" in jargon-like fashion without thinking.                            Steele: "Aha!  We've finally got you talking jargon too!"                        Stallman: "What did he say?"

The way it comes up is, my 5-year-old              will be watching TV cartoon shows in the morning, and they'll show a             commercial for a children's compressed breakfast compound such as                "Froot Loops" or "Lucky Charms", and they always show it sitting on a            table next to some actual food such as eggs, and the announcer always            says: "Part of this complete breakfast".  Don't that really mean,                "Adjacent to this complete breakfast", or "On the same table as this             complete breakfast"?  And couldn't they make essentially the same claim          if, instead of Froot Loops, they put a can of shaving cream there, or a          dead bat?                                                                        .                                                                                Answer: Yes.                                                                                     -- Dave Barry, "Tips for Writer's"                               10                                                                               Dear Mister Language Person: What is the purpose of the apostrophe?              .                                                                                Answer: The apostrophe is used mainly in hand-lettered small business            signs to alert the reader than an "S" is coming up at the end of a               word, as in: WE DO NOT EXCEPT PERSONAL CHECK'S, or: NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR          ANY ITEM'S.  Another important grammar concept to bear in mind when              creating hand- lettered small-business signs is that you should put              quotation marks around random words for decoration, as in "TRY" OUR HOT          DOG'S, or even TRY "OUR" HOT DOG'S.                                                              -- Dave Barry, "Tips for Writer's"                               1                                                                                Death is God's way of telling you not to be such a wise guy.                     2                                                                                Death is life's way of telling you you've been fired.                                            -- R.

Electrons travel at the speed of light, which in            most American homes is 110 volts per hour.  This is very fast.  In the           time it has taken you to read this sentence so far, an electron could            have traveled all the way from San Francisco to Hackensack, New Jersey,          although God alone knows why it would want to.                                           The five main kinds of electricity are alternating current,              direct current, lightning, static, and European.  Most American homes            have alternating current, which means that the electricity goes in one           direction for a while, then goes in the other direction.  This prevents          harmful electron buildup in the wires.                                                           -- Dave Barry, "The Taming of the Screw"                         2                                                                                Electrocution, n.:                                                                       Burning at the stake with all the modern improvements.                   1                                                                                Elevators smell different to midgets                                             3                                                                                Emersons' Law of Contrariness:                                                           Our chief want in life is somebody who shall make us do what we                  can.

Horses have an even number of legs.  Behind they have two legs, and in           front they have fore-legs.  This makes six legs, which is certainly an           odd number of legs for a horse.  But the only number that is both even           and odd is infinity.  Therefore, horses have an infinite number of               legs.  Now to show this for the general case, suppose that somewhere,            there is a horse that has a finite number of legs.  But that is a horse          of another color, and by the [above] lemma ["All horses are the same             color"], that does not exist.                                                    2                                                                                Every improvement in communication makes the bore more terrible.                                 -- Frank Moore Colby                                             1                                                                                Every journalist has a novel in him, which is an excellent place for it.         2                                                                                Every little picofarad has a nanohenry all its own.                                              -- Don Vonada                                                    1                                                                                "Every man has his price.

If              you're ever walking down the street and you notice some people who look          particularly smug, the odds are that they are taking tools for                   granted.

HOFFMAN: You mean the oysters I buy are not nature's oysters?                    DINGELL: They may or may not be natural.  The simple fact of the matter                   is that female oysters through their living habits cast out                      large amounts of seed and the male oysters cast out large                        amounts of fertilization ...

No one ever expects anything              drinkable to be in a bottle which has a candle stuck in its neck.                1                                                                                fortune: cpu time/usefulness ratio too high -- core dumped.                      5                                                                                Fortune: You will be attacked next Wednesday at 3:15 p.m. by six samuri          sword wielding purple fish glued to Harley-Davidson motorcycles.                 .

Derived from FROBNITZ.                       Usually abbreviated to FROB.  Thus one has the saying "to frob                   a frob".  See TWEAK and TWIDDLE.  Usage: FROB, TWIDDLE, and                      TWEAK sometimes connote points along a continuum.  FROB                          connotes aimless manipulation; TWIDDLE connotes gross                            manipulation, often a coarse search for a proper setting; TWEAK                  connotes fine-tuning.  If someone is turning a knob on an                        oscilloscope, then if he's carefully adjusting it he is                          probably tweaking it; if he is just turning it but looking at                    the screen he is probably twiddling it; but if he's just doing                   it because turning a knob is fun, he's frobbing it.                      8                                                                                Frobnitz, pl.

This rare form is usually abbreviated to                FROTZ, or more commonly to FROB.  Also used are FROBNULE, FROBULE, and           FROBNODULE.  Starting perhaps in 1979, FROBBOZ (fruh-bahz'), pl.                 FROBBOTZIM, has also become very popular, largely due to its exposure            via the Adventure spin-off called Zork (Dungeon).  These can also be             applied to non-physical objects, such as data structures.                        12                                                                               [From an announcement of a congress of the International Ontopsychology          Association, in Rome]:                                                           .                                                                                The Ontopsychological school, availing itself of new research criteria           and of a new telematic epistemology, maintains that social modes do not          spring from dialectics of territory or of class, or of consumer goods,           or of means of power, but rather from dynamic latencies capillarized in          millions of individuals in system functions which, once they have                reached the event maturation, burst forth in catastrophic phenomenology          engaging a suitable stereotype protagonist or duty marionette (general,          president, political party, etc.) to consummate the act of social                schizophrenia in mass genocide.                                                  10                                                                               From the "Guiness Book of World Records", 1973:                                  .

Clearly the best thing you can do for you children is to start           speaking Yiddish right now and never speak another word of English as            long as you live.  This will, of course, entail teaching Yiddish to all          your friends, business associates, the people at the supermarket, and            so on, but that's just the point.  It has to start with committed                individuals and then grow ...                                                            Some minor adjustments will have to be made, of course: those            signs written in what look like Yiddish letters won't be funny when              everything is written in Yiddish.  And we'll have to start driving on            the left side of the road so we won't be reading the street signs                backwards.  But is that too high a price to pay for world peace?

This is easy.  You never have to figure out what to get for children,            because they will tell you exactly what they want.  They spend months            and months researching these kinds of things by watching Saturday-               morning cartoon-show advertisements.  Make sure you get your children            exactly what they ask for, even if you disapprove of their choices.  If          your child thinks he wants Murderous Bob, the Doll with the Face You             Can Rip Right Off, you'd better get it.  You may be worried that it              might help to encourage your child's antisocial tendencies, but believe          me, you have not seen antisocial tendencies until you've seen a child            who is convinced that he or she did not get the right gift.                                      -- Dave Barry, "Christmas Shopping: A Survivor's Guide"          18                                                                                                       -- Gifts for Men --                                      .                                                                                Men are amused by almost any idiot thing -- that is why professional             ice hockey is so popular -- so buying gifts for them is easy.  But you           should never buy them clothes.  Men believe they already have all the            clothes they will ever need, and new ones make them nervous.  For                example, your average man has 84 ties, but he wears, at most, only               three of them.  He has learned, through humiliating trial and error,             that if he wears any of the other 81 ties, his wife will probably laugh          at him ("You're not going to wear THAT tie with that suit, are you?").           So he has narrowed it down to three safe ties, and has gone several              years without being laughed at.  If you give him a new tie, he will              pretend to like it, but deep inside he will hate you.                            .

Did you notice how your friend twitched violently and cried out in               pain?  This teaches us that electricity can be a very powerful force,            but we must never use it to hurt others unless we need to learn an               important electrical lesson.                                                     .                                                                                It also teaches us how an electrical circuit works.  When you scuffed            your feet, you picked up batches of "electrons", which are very small            objects that carpet manufacturers weave into carpets so they will                attract dirt.  The electrons travel through your bloodstream and                 collect in your finger, where they form a spark that leaps to your               friend's filling, then travels down to his feet and back into the                carpet, thus completing the circuit.                                             .                                                                                Amazing Electronic Fact: If you scuffed your feet long enough without            touching anything, you would build up so many electrons that your                finger would explode!  But this is nothing to worry about unless you             have carpeting.                                                                                  -- Dave Barry, "What is Electricity?"                            13                                                                                       Here is the fact of the week, maybe even the fact of the                 month.  According to probably reliable sources, the Coca-Cola people             are experiencing severe marketing anxiety in China.                                      The words "Coca-Cola" translate into Chinese as either                   (depending on the inflection) "wax-fattened mare" or "bite the wax               tadpole".

The trouble with this fact, as lovely as it is, is that it's             hard to get a whole column out of it. I'd like to teach the world to             bite a wax tadpole.

Notice I say            "shop for", as opposed to "obtain".  This is the major drawback of home          centers: they are always out of everything except artificial Christmas           trees.  The home center employees have no time to reorder merchandise            because they are too busy applying little price stickers to every                object--every board, washer, nail and screw--in the entire store ...                     Let's say a piece in your toilet tank breaks, so you remove the          broken part, take it to the home center, and ask an employee if he has           a replacement.  The employee, who has never is his life even seen the            inside of a toilet tank, will peer at the broken part in very much the           same way that a member of a primitive Amazon jungle tribe would look at          an electronic calculator, and then say, "We're expecting a shipment of           these sometime around the middle of next week".                                                  -- Dave Barry, "The Taming of the Screw"                         3                                                                                Home of Doberman Propulsion Laboratories:                                        The ultimate in watchdog weaponry.                                                               -- Chris Shaw                                                    1                                                                                "Honesty is the best policy, but insanity is a better defense"                   2                                                                                Honesty pays, but it doesn't seem to pay enough to suit some people.                             -- F.

Ignoring his department chief, and tying his assistant to an              operating table to prevent his interference, he placed a uretheral               catheter into a vein in his arm, advanced it to the right atrium [of             his heart], and walked upstairs to the x-ray department where he took            the confirmatory x-ray film.

I ran it assuming the superfluid currents beneath the crust to be                absent -- not because I wanted to know the answer, but because I had             developed an intuitive feel for the answer in this particular case.

The                   "professional" arrives in a truck with lettering on the sides and                deposits a large quantity of tools and two assistants who spend the              better part of the week in your basement whacking objects at random              with heavy wrenches, after which the "professional" returns and gives            you a bill for slightly more money than it would cost you to run a               successful campaign for the U.S. Senate.                                                 And that's why you've decided to start doing things yourself.            You figure, "If those guys can fix my furnace, then so can I.  How               difficult can it be?"                                                                    Very difficult.  In fact, most home projects are impossible,             which is why you should do them yourself.

"Come now, friend rabbit, you know that's impossible!"                           "Well, follow me and I'll show you."  They both go into the              rabbit's dwelling and after a while the rabbit emerges with a satisfied          expression on his face.                                                                  Comes along a wolf.  "Hello, what are we doing these days?"                      "I'm writing the second chapter of my thesis, on how rabbits             devour wolves."                                                                          "Are you crazy?  Where is your academic honesty?"                                "Come with me and I'll show you."  As before, the rabbit comes           out with a satisfied look on his face and a diploma in his paw.                  Finally, the camera pans into the rabbit's cave and, as everybody                should have guessed by now, we see a mean-looking, huge lion sitting             next to some bloody and furry remnants of the wolf and the fox.                  .

One slow day, he found that he           had time to chat with the new entrants.  To the first one he asked,              "What's your IQ?"  The new arrival replied, "190".  They discussed               Einstein's theory of relativity for hours.  When the second new arrival          came, Einstein once again inquired as to the newcomer's IQ.  The answer          this time came "120".  To which Einstein replied, "Tell me, how did the          Cubs do this year?" and they proceeded to talk for half an hour or so.           To the final arrival, Einstein once again posed the question, "What's            your IQ?".  Upon receiving the answer "70", Einstein smiled and asked,           "Got a minute to tell me about VMS 4.0?"                                         5                                                                                It happened that a fire broke out backstage in a theater.  The clown             came out to inform the public.  They thought it was just a jest and              applauded.  He repeated his warning, they shouted even louder.  So I             think the world will come to an end amid general applause from all the           wits, who believe that it is a joke.                                             4                                                                                It has been observed that one's nose is never so happy as when it is             thrust into the affairs of another, from which some physiologists have           drawn the inference that the nose is devoid of the sense of smell.                               -- Ambrose Bierce, "The Devil's Dictionary"                      4                                                                                It has been said [by Anatole France], "it is not by amusing oneself              that one learns," and, in reply: "it is *____^H^H^H^Honly* by amusing oneself th one can learn."                                                                                  -- Edward Kasner and James R.

What fun is there in making plans, acquiring discipline in             organizing thoughts, devoting attention to detail, and learning to be            self-critical?                                                                                   -- Alan Perlis                                                   2                                                                                It is against the law for a monster to enter the corporate limits of             Urbana, Illinois.                                                                5                                                                                It is always preferable to visit home with a friend.

For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed            that he was more intelligent than dolphins because he had achieved so            much -- the wheel, New York wars and so on -- whilst all the dolphins            had ever done was muck about in the water having a good time.  But               conversely, the dolphins had always believed that they were far more             intelligent than man -- for precisely the same reasons.                          .

Long ago, in a finite state far away, there lived a JOVIAL               character named Jack.  Jack and his relations were poor.  Often their            hash table was bare.  One day Jack's parent said to him, "Our matrices           are sparse.  You must go to the market to exchange our RAM for some              BASICs."  She compiled a linked list of items to retrieve and passed it          to him.                                                                                  So Jack set out.  But as he was walking along a Hamilton path,           he met the traveling salesman.                                                           "Whither dost thy flow chart take thou?" prompted the salesman           in high-level language.                                                                  "I'm going to the market to exchange this RAM for some chips             and Apples," commented Jack.                                                             "I have a much better algorithm.  You needn't join a queue               there; I will swap your RAM for these magic kernels now."                                Jack made the trade, then backtracked to his house.

"The experienced driver", he says, "will usually know                what's wrong."                                                                   3                                                                                Kerr's Three Rules for a Successful College:                                             Have plenty of football for the alumni, sex for the students,                    and parking for the faculty.                                             8                                                                                Kids have *_____^H^H^H^H^Hnever* taken guidance from their parents.

She'd whimper and tug at their               sleeves, and they'd always waste precious minutes saying things: "Do             you think something's wrong?  Do you think she wants us to follow her?           What is it, girl?", etc., as if this had never happened before, instead          of every week.

Here's an often          overlooked accounting technique that can save you thousands of                   dollars:  For several days before you put it in the mail, carry your             tax return around under your armpit.  No IRS agent is going to want to           spend hours poring over a sweat-stained document.  So even if you owe            money, you can put in for an enormous refund and the agent will                  probably give it to you, just to avoid an audit.  What does he care?             It's not his money.                                                                              -- Dave Barry, "Sweating Out Taxes"                              13                                                                               LETTERS TO THE EDITOR (The Times of London)                                      .

The fact is, lobsters are among the most                 ferocious predators on the sea floor, and you're helping reduce crime            in the reefs.  Grasp the lobster behind the head, look it right in its           unmistakably guilty eyestalks and say, "Where were you on the night of           the 21st?", then flourish a picture of a scallop or a sole and shout,            "Perhaps this will refresh that crude neural apparatus you call a                memory!"  The lobster will squirm noticeably.  It may even take a swipe          at you with one of its claws.  Incorrigible.  Pop it into the pot.

The match started with a long period of silence while           the Freudians waited for the Rogerians to free associate and the                 Rogerians waited for the Freudians to say something they could                   paraphrase.  The stalemate was broken when the Freudians' best player            took the offensive and interpreted the Rogerians' silence as reflecting          their anal-retentive personalities.  At this the Rogerians' star player          said "I hear you saying you think we're full of ka-ka."

So generally when two fish want to have sex, they swim around             and around for hours, looking for someplace to go, until finally the             female gets really tired and has a terrible headache, and she just               dumps her eggs right on the sand and swims away.  Then the male, driven          by some timeless, noble instinct for survival, eats the eggs.  So the            truth is that fish don't reproduce at all, but there are so many of              them that it doesn't make any difference.                                                        -- Dave Barry, "Sex and the Single Amoeba: What Every                               Teen Should Know"                                             3                                                                                Most people can't understand how others can blow their noses differently         than they do.                                                                                    -- Turgenev                                                      2                                                                                Most people wouldn't know music if it came up and bit them on the ass.                           -- Frank Zappa                                                   2                                                                                Mother is far too clever to understand anything she does not like.                               -- Arnold Bennett                                                1                                                                                Mother is the invention of necessity.                                            1                                                                                Mother told me to be good, but she's been wrong before.                          3                                                                                Mr. Cole's Axiom:                                                                        The sum of the intelligence on the planet is a constant; the                     population is growing.                                                   10                                                                               "Multiply in your head" (ordered the compassionate Dr. Adams)                    "365,365,365,365,365,365 by 365,365,365,365,365,365.

Murray just got a new camera and is constantly snapping                  pictures.  One day, without knowing it, he photographs a top-secret              military installation.  In an instant, armed troops surround Murray and          Esther and hustle them off to prison.                                                    They can't prove who they are because they've left their                 passports in their hotel room.  For three weeks they're tortured day             and night to get them to name their contacts in the liberation                   movement..  Finally they're hauled in front of a military court,                 charged with espionage, and sentenced to death.                                          The next morning they're lined up in front of the wall where             they'll be shot.  The sergeant in charge of the firing squad asks them           if they have any lasts requests.  Esther wants to know if she can call           her daughter in Chicago.  The sergeant says he's sorry, that's not               possible, and turns to Murray.                                                           "This is crazy!"  Murray shouts.  "We're not spies!"  And he             spits in the sergeants face.                                                             "Murray!"  Esther cries.  "Please!

We did not act in haste.           First we checked to make sure the amplifier would fit through the                frame, using the belt from my bathrobe to measure, then we picked up             the amplifier and backed up to my bedroom door.  Then we rushed                  forward, shouting "The WHO!  The WHO!" and we launched my amplifier              perfectly, as though we had been doing it all our lives, clean through           the window and down onto the sidewalk, where a small but appreciative            crowd had gathered.  I would like to be able to say that this was a              symbolic act, an effort on my part to break cleanly away from one state          in my life and move on to another, but the truth is, Cooper and I                really just wanted to find out what it would sound like.  It sounded             OK.                                                                                              -- Dave Barry, "The Snake"                                       3                                                                                "My doctor told me to stop having intimate dinners for four.

"Then how do you know it was me?"                                      3                                                                                Nasrudin walked into a teahouse and declaimed, "The moon is more useful          than the sun."  "Why?", he was asked.  "Because at night we need the             light more."                                                                     5                                                                                Nasrudin was carrying home a piece of liver and the recipe for liver             pie.  Suddenly a bird of prey swooped down and snatched the piece of             meat from his hand.  As the bird flew off, Nasrudin called after it,             "Foolish bird!  You have the liver, but what can you do with it without          the recipe?"                                                                     5                                                                                Nature abhors a hero.  For one thing, he violates the law of                     conservation of energy.  For another, how can it be the survival of the          fittest when the fittest keeps putting himself in situations where he            is most likely to be creamed?                                                                    -- Solomon Short                                                 5                                                                                Nature and nature's laws lay hid in night,                                       God said, "Let Newton be," and all was light.                                    .

(1) Do I dare trust a person who actually considers alfalfa sprouts a                food?                                                                        (2) Was the author's sole motive in writing this book to get rich                    exploiting the forlorn hopes of chubby people like me?                       (3) Would a longer life be worthwhile if it had to be lived as                       prescribed ... without French-fried onion rings, pizza with                      double cheese, or the occasional Mai-Tai?  (Remember, living                     right doesn't really make you live longer, it just *seems* like                  longer.)                                                                     .

Now you're ready for the actual shopping.  Your goal should be to            get it over with as quickly as possible, because the longer you stay in          the mall, the longer your children will have to listen to holiday songs          on the mall public-address system, and many of these songs can damage            children emotionally.  For example: "Frosty the Snowman" is about a              snowman who befriends some children, plays with them until they learn            to love him, then melts.  And "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" is about          a young reindeer who, because of a physical deformity, is treated as an          outcast by the other reindeer.  Then along comes good, old Santa.  Does          he ignore the deformity?  Does he look past Rudolph's nose and respect           Rudolph for the sensitive reindeer he is underneath?

An excellent question.                                         Go to one of those really cheap discount stores where they sell          plastic furniture in colors visible from the planet Neptune and where            they have a food section specializing in cardboard cartons full of               Raisinets and malted milk balls manufactured during the Nixon                    administration.  In either the hardware or housewares department,                you'll find an item imported from an obscure Oriental country and                described as "Nine Tools in One", consisting of a little handle with             interchangeable ends representing inscrutable Oriental notions of tools          that Americans might use around the home.  Buy it.                                       This is the kind of tool set professionals use.  Not only is it          inexpensive, but it also has a great safety feature not found in the             so-called quality tools sets: The handle will actually break right off           if you accidentally hit yourself or anything else, or expose it to               direct sunlight.                                                                                 -- Dave Barry, "The Taming of the Screw"                         2                                                                                "Nuclear war would really set back cable."                                                       -- Ted Turner                                                    2                                                                                [Nuclear war] ... may not be desirable.                                                          -- Edwin Meese III                                               1                                                                                Nudists are people who wear one-button suits.                                    2                                                                                Numeric stability is probably not all that important when you're                 guessing.                                                                        6                                                                                O give me a home,                                                                Where the buffalo roam,                                                          Where the deer and the antelope play,                                            Where seldom is heard                                                            A discouraging word,                                                             'Cause what can an antelope say?                                                 2                                                                                O'Toole's Commentary on Murphy's Law:                                                    Murphy was an optimist.                                                  2                                                                                "Of ______^H^H^H^H^H^Hcourse it's the murder weapon.

Each creature in its own manner clung tightly to           the twigs and rocks of the river bottom, for clinging was their way of           life, and resisting the current what each had learned from birth.  But           one creature said at last, "I trust that the current knows where it is           going.  I shall let go, and let it take me where it will.  Clinging, I           shall die of boredom."                                                                   The other creatures laughed and said, "Fool!  Let go, and that           current you worship will throw you tumbled and smashed across the                rocks, and you will die quicker than boredom!"                                           But the one heeded them not, and taking a breath did let go,             and at once was tumbled and smashed by the current across the rocks.             Yet, in time, as the creature refused to cling again, the current                lifted him free from the bottom, and he was bruised and hurt no more.                    And the creatures downstream, to whom he was a stranger, cried,          "See a miracle!  A creature like ourselves, yet he flies!  See the               Messiah, come to save us all!"  And the one carried in the current               said, "I am no more Messiah than you.  The river delight to lift us              free, if only we dare let go.  Our true work is this voyage, this                adventure.                                                                               But they cried the more, "Saviour!" all the while clinging to            the rocks, making legends of a Saviour.                                          18                                                                               Once upon a time, when I was training to be a mathematician, a group of          us bright young students taking number theory discovered the names of            the smaller prime numbers.                                                       .                                                                                2:  The Odd Prime --                                                                     It's the only even prime, therefore is odd.

We needed an arbitrary prime                    in case the prof asked for one, and so had an election.  91                      received the most votes (well, it *looks* prime) and 3+4i the                    next most.  However, 31 was the only candidate to receive none                   at all.                                                                  .                                                                                Since the composite numbers are formed from primes, their qualities are          derived from those primes.  So, for instance, the number 6 is "odd but           true", while the powers of 2 are all extremely odd numbers.                      7                                                                                ... Once you're safely in the mall, you should tie your children to you          with ropes so the other shoppers won't try to buy them.  Holiday                 shoppers have been whipped into a frenzy by months of holiday                    advertisements, and they will buy anything small enough to stuff into a          shopping bag.  If your children object to being tied, threaten to take           them to see Santa Claus; that ought to shut them up.                                             -- Dave Barry, "Christmas Shopping: A Survivor's Guide"          3                                                                                Once, adv.:                                                                              Enough.                                                                                  -- Ambrose Bierce, "The Devil's Dictionary"                      3                                                                                One advantage of talking to yourself is that you know at least                   somebody's listening.                                                                            -- Franklin P.

Reading the Bible straight through is at             least 70 percent discipline, like learning Latin.  But the good parts            are, of course, simply amazing.  God is an extremely uneven writer, but          when He's good, nobody can touch Him.                                                            -- John Gardner, NYT Book Review, Jan 1983                       3                                                                                One of the lessons of history is that nothing is often a good thing to           do and always a clever thing to say.                                                             -- Will Durant                                                   4                                                                                One of the oldest problems puzzled over in the Talmud is: "Why did God           create goyim?"

Unix was written on our machines and for our machines many               years ago.  Today, much of UNIX being done is done on our machines.              Ten percent of our VAXs are going for UNIX use.  UNIX is a simple                language, easy to understand, easy to get started with.  It's great for          students, great for somewhat casual users, and it's great for                    interchanging programs between different machines.  And so, because of           its popularity in these markets, we support it.  We have good UNIX on            VAX and good UNIX on PDP-11s.                                                            It is our belief, however, that serious professional users will          run out of things they can do with UNIX. They'll want a real system and          will end up doing VMS when they get to be serious about programming.                     With UNIX, if you're looking for something, you can easily and           quickly check that small manual and find out that it's not there.  With          VMS, no matter what you look for -- it's literally a five-foot shelf of          documentation -- if you look long enough it's there.  That's the                 difference -- the beauty of UNIX is it's simple; and the beauty of VMS           is that it's all there.                                                                          -- Ken Olsen, President of DEC, 1984                             5                                                                                One of the rules of Busmanship, New York style, is never surrender your          seat to another passenger.  This may seem callous, but it is the best            way, really.  If one passenger were to give a seat to someone who                fainted in the aisle, say, the others on the bus would become                    disoriented and imagine they were in Topeka, Kansas.                             4                                                                                One of the Ten Commandments for Technicians                                              (7) Work thou not on energized equipment, for if thou dost, thy                      fellow workers will surely buy beers for thy widow and                           console her in other ways.                                           4                                                                                One of the Ten Commandments for Technicians:                                             (1) Beware the lightening that lurketh in the undischarged                           capacitor, lest it cause thee to bounce upon thy buttocks                        in a most untechnician-like manner.                                  4                                                                                One Page Principle:                                                                      A specification that will not fit on one page of 8.5x11 inch                     paper cannot be understood.                                                              -- Mark Ardis                                                    1                                                                                "One planet is all you get."                                                     17                                                                               One promising concept that I came up with right away was that you could          manufacture personal air bags, then get a law passed requiring that              they be installed on congressmen to keep them from taking trips.  Let's          say your congressman was trying to travel to Paris to do a fact-finding          study on how the French government handles diseases transmitted by               sherbet.  Just when he got to the plane, his mandatory air bag,                  strapped around his waist, would inflate -- FWWAAAAAAPPPP -- thus                rendering him too large to fit through the plane door.  It could also            be rigged to inflate whenever the congressman proposed a law.  ("Mr.             Speaker, people ask me, why should October be designated as Cuticle              Inspection Month?  And I answer that FWWAAAAAAPPPP.") This would save            millions of dollars, so I have no doubt that the public would violently          support a law requiring airbags on congressmen.  The problem is that             your potential market is very small: there are only around 500 members           of Congress, and some of them, such as House Speaker "Tip" O'Neil, are           already too large to fit on normal aircraft.                                                     -- Dave Barry, "'Mister Mediocre' Restaurants"                   5                                                                                One reason why George Washington                                                 Is held in such veneration:                                                      He never blamed his problems                                                     On the former Administration.                                                                    -- George O.

In fact, you can solve many home plumbing                problems, such as annoying faucet drip, merely by turning up the                 radio.  But before we get into specific techniques, let's look at how            plumbing works.                                                                          A plumbing system is very much like your electrical system,              except that instead of electricity, it has water, and instead of wires,          it has pipes, and instead of radios and waffle irons, it has faucets             and toilets.  So the truth is that your plumbing systems is nothing at           all like your electrical system, which is good, because electricity can          kill you.                                                                                        -- Dave Barry, "The Taming of the Screw"                         7                                                                                PLUNDERER'S THEME                                                                (to Supercalifragilisticexpialidocius)                                           .

We know it's true for _^Hn equal to 1.  Now assume that it's true        for every natural number less than _^Hn.  _^HN is arbitrary, so we can take _^Hn as large as we want.  If _^Hn is sufficiently large, the case of _^Hn+1 is       trivially equivalent, so the only important _^Hn are _^Hn less than _^Hn.  We    can take _^Hn = _^Hn (from above), so it's true for _^Hn+1 because it's just     about _^Hn.                                                                              QED.

(2) They have two legs in back and fore legs in front.

(4) But the only number that is both odd and even is infinity.

But I repeat myself.                                                                  -- Mark Twain                                                    4                                                                                Real computer scientists admire ADA for its overwhelming aesthetic               value but they find it difficult to actually program in it, as it is             much too large to implement.  Most computer scientists don't notice              this because they are still arguing over what else to add to ADA.                3                                                                                Real computer scientists despise the idea of actual hardware.  Hardware          has limitations, software doesn't.  It's a real shame that Turing                machines are so poor at I/O.                                                     2                                                                                Real computer scientists don't comment their code.  The identifiers are          so long they can't afford the disk space.                                        2                                                                                Real computer scientists don't program in assembler.  They don't write           in anything less portable than a number two pencil.                              4                                                                                Real computer scientists don't write code.  They occasionally tinker             with `programming systems', but those are so high level that they                hardly count (and rarely count accurately; precision is for                      applications.)                                                                   3                                                                                Real computer scientists only write specs for languages that might run           on future hardware.  Nobody trusts them to write specs for anything homo         sapiens will ever be able to fit on a single planet.                             4                                                                                Real programmers disdain structured programming.  Structured                     programming is for compulsive neurotics who were prematurely toilet-             trained.  They wear neckties and carefully line up pencils on otherwise          clear desks.                                                                     3                                                                                Real programmers don't bring brown-bag lunches.  If the vending machine          doesn't sell it, they don't eat it.  Vending machines don't sell                 quiche.                                                                          2                                                                                Real programmers don't comment their code.  It was hard to write, it             should be hard to understand.                                                    3                                                                                Real programmers don't draw flowcharts.  Flowcharts are, after all, the          illiterate's form of documentation.  Cavemen drew flowcharts; look how           much good it did them.                                                           4                                                                                Real Programmers don't play tennis, or any other sport that requires             you to change clothes.  Mountain climbing is OK, and real programmers            wear their climbing boots to work in case a mountain should suddenly             spring up in the middle of the machine room.                                     2                                                                                Real programmers don't write in BASIC.  Actually, no programmers write           in BASIC after reaching puberty.                                                 3                                                                                Real programmers don't write in FORTRAN.  FORTRAN is for pipe stress             freaks and crystallography weenies.  FORTRAN is for wimp engineers who           wear white socks.                                                                2                                                                                Real Programmers don't write in PL/I.  PL/I is for programmers who               can't decide whether to write in COBOL or FORTRAN.                               1                                                                                Real Programmers think better when playing Adventure or Rogue.                   2                                                                                Real Programs don't use shared text.  Otherwise, how can they use                functions for scratch space after they are finished calling them?                3                                                                                Real software engineers don't debug programs, they verify correctness.           This process doesn't necessarily involve execution of anything on a              computer, except perhaps a Correctness Verification Aid package.                 7                                                                                Real software engineers don't like the idea of some inexplicable and             greasy hardware several aisles away that may stop working at any                 moment.  They have a great distrust of hardware people, and wish that            systems could be virtual at *___^H^H^Hall* levels.  They would like personal     computers (you know no one's going to trip over something and kill your          DFA in mid-transit), except that they need 8 megabytes to run their              Correctness Verification Aid packages.                                           3                                                                                Real software engineers work from 9 to 5, because that is the way the            job is described in the formal spec.  Working late would feel like               using an undocumented external procedure.                                        3                                                                                Real Time, adj.:                                                                         Here and now, as opposed to fake time, which only occurs there                   and then.                                                                2                                                                                Real Users are afraid they'll break the machine -- but they're never             afraid to break your face.                                                       2                                                                                Real Users find the one combination of bizarre input values that shuts           down the system for days.                                                        1                                                                                Real Users hate Real Programmers.                                                1                                                                                Real Users know your home telephone number.                                      2                                                                                Real Users never know what they want, but they always know when your             program doesn't deliver it.                                                      1                                                                                Real Users never use the Help key.                                               11                                                                               Real World, The n.:                                                                      1.

To            programmers, the location of non-programmers and activities not related          to programming.  3. A universe in which the standard dress is shirt and          tie and in which a person's working hours are defined as 9 to 5.  4.             The location of the status quo.  5. Anywhere outside a university.               "Poor fellow, he's left MIT and gone into the real world."  Used                 pejoratively by those not in residence there.

It may take several portions to                         accomplish this, especially if subtly seasoned.                             (7)  Really feel your food.  Texture is important.  Compare,                          for example, the texture of a turnip to that of a                                brownie.  Which feels better against your cheeks?                           (8)  Never eat between snacks, unless it's a meal.                               (9)  Don't feel you must finish everything on your plate.

(1) Little things start bothering you: little things like worms, bugs,               ants.                                                                        (2) Something is missing in your personal relationships.                         (3) Your dog becomes overly affectionate.                                        (4) You have a hard time getting a waiter.                                       (5) Exotic birds flock around you.                                               (6) People ignore you at parties.                                                (7) You have a hard time getting up in the morning.

(2)  When you're flying through the air, remember to roll when you hit                the ground.                                                                 (3)  If you're on fire, avoid gasoline and other flammable materials.            (4)  Don't attempt communication with dead people; it will only lead to               psychological problems.                                                     (5)  Food will be scarce; you will have to scavenge.  Learn to                        recognize foods that will be available after the bomb: mashed                    potatoes, shredded wheat, tossed salad, ground beef, etc.                   (6)  Put your hand over your mouth when you sneeze; internal organs                   will be scarce in the post-nuclear age.                                     (7)  Try to be neat; fall only in designated piles.                              (8)  Drive carefully in "Heavy Fallout" areas; people could be                        staggering illegally.                                                       (9)  Nutritionally, hundred dollar bills are equal to ones, but more                  sanitary due to limited circulation.

You have a reckless                        tendency to rely on luck since you lack talent.  The majority                    of Sagittarians are drunks or dope fiends or both.

The result provoked wry             comments on the rather patchy papal infallibility, and Pope Sixtus had           no recourse but to order the return and destruction of every copy.               4                                                                                Skinner's Constant (or Flannagan's Finagling Factor):                                    That quantity which, when multiplied by, divided by, added to,                   or subtracted from the answer you get, gives you the answer you                  should have gotten.                                                      2                                                                                Slang is language that takes off its coat, spits on its hands, and goes          to work.                                                                         10                                                                               Slaves are generally expected to sing as well as to work ... I did not,          when a slave, understand the deep meanings of those rude, and                    apparently incoherent songs.  I was myself within the circle, so that I          neither saw nor heard as those without might see and hear.  They told a          tale which was then altogether beyond my feeble comprehension:  they             were tones, loud, long and deep, breathing the prayer and complaint of           souls boiling over with the bitterest anguish.  Every tone was a                 testimony against slavery, and a prayer to God for deliverance from              chains.                                                                                          -- Frederick Douglass                                            7                                                                                Slick's Three Laws of the Universe:                                                      (1) Nothing in the known universe travels faster than a bad                          check.

OK!  Got everything?  Well, *too bad, sucker*, because while you             were gone the electronics industry came up with an even newer format             that makes your 8-millimeter VCR look as technologically advanced as             toenail dirt.  This format is called "3.5 hectare" and it will not be            made available until it is outmoded, sometime early next week, by a              format called "Elroy", so *order yours now*.                                                     -- Dave Barry, "No Surrender in the Electronics                                     Revolution"                                                   3                                                                                So far as I can remember, there is not one word in the Gospels in                praise of intelligence.                                                                          -- Bertrand Russell                                              5                                                                                ... so long as the people do not care to exercise their freedom, those           who wish to tyrranize will do so; for tyrants are active and ardent,             and will devote themselves in the name of any number of gods, religious          and otherwise, to put shackles upon sleeping men.                                                -- Voltarine de Cleyre                                           20                                                                                       So Richard and I decided to try to catch [the small shark].              With a great deal of strategy and effort and shouting, we managed to             maneuver the shark, over the course of about a half-hour, to a sort of           corner of the lagoon, so that it had no way to escape other than to              flop up onto the land and evolve.  Richard and I were inching toward             it, sort of crouched over, when all of a sudden it turned around and --          I can still remember the sensation I felt at that moment, primarily in           the armpit area -- headed right straight toward us.                                      Many people would have panicked at this point.  But Richard and          I were not "many people."  We were experienced waders, and we kept our           heads.  We did exactly what the textbook says you should do when you're          unarmed and a shark that is nearly two feet long turns on you in water           up to your lower calves: We sprinted I would say 600 yards in the                opposite direction, using a sprinting style such that the bottoms of             our feet never once went below the surface of the water.  We ran all             the way to the far shore, and if we had been in a Warner Brothers                cartoon we would have run right INTO the beach, and you would have seen          these two mounds of sand racing across the island until they bonked              into trees and coconuts fell onto their heads.                                                   -- Dave Barry, "The Wonders of Sharks on TV"                     8                                                                                "So she went into the garden to cut a cabbage leaf to make an apple              pie; and at the same time a great she-bear, coming up the street pops            its head into the shop. "What! no soap?"  So he died, and she very               imprudently married the barber; and there were present the Picninnies,           and the Grand Panjandrum himself, with the little round button at top,           and they all fell to playing the game of catch as catch can, till the            gunpowder ran out at the heels of their boots."                                                  -- Samuel Foote                                                  16                                                                               ... So the documentary-makers stick with sharks.  Generally, their               procedure is to scatter bleeding fish pieces around their boat, so as            to infest the waters.  I would estimate that the primary food source of          sharks today is bleeding fish pieces scattered by people making                  documentaries.  Once the sharks arrive, they are generally fairly                listless.  The general shark attitude seems to be: "Oh God, another              documentary."  So the divers have to somehow goad them into attacking,           under the guise of Scientific Research.  "We know very little about the          effect of electricity on sharks," the narrator will say, in a deeply             scientific voice.  "That is why Todd is going to jab this Great White            in the testicles with a cattle prod."  The divers keep this kind of              thing up until the shark finally gets irritated and snaps at them, and           then they act as though this was a totally unexpected and very                   dangerous development, although clearly it is what they wanted all               along.                                                                                           -- Dave Barry, "The Wonders of Sharks on TV"                     2                                                                                So, what's with this guy Gideon, anyway?

Well, you can forget it.  If everybody pulled that kind          of subversive stunt, the economy would collapse overnight.  The                  government would have to intervene: it would form a cabinet-level                Department of Holiday Gift-Giving, which would spend billions and                billions of tax dollars to buy Barbie dolls and electronic games, which          it would drop on the populace from Air Force jets, killing and maiming           thousands.

And the characters in these books and plays and so on (and in real          life, I might add) spend hours bemoaning the fact that they can't                communicate.

Cities contain streets, which are dangerous and crowded and             difficult to park in.  Malls, on the other hand, have parking lots,              which are also dangerous and crowded and difficult to park in, but --            here is the big difference -- in mall parking lots, THERE ARE NO                 RULES.  You're allowed to do anything.  You can drive as fast as you             want in any direction you want.  I was once driving in a mall parking            lot when my car was struck by a pickup truck being driven backward by a          squat man with a tattoo that said "Charlie" on his forearm, who got out          and explained to me, in great detail, why the accident was my fault,             his reasoning being that he was violent and muscular, whereas I was              neither.  This kind of reasoning is legally valid in mall parking                lots.                                                                                            -- Dave Barry, "Christmas Shopping: A Survivor's Guide"          13                                                                               The basic menu item, in fact the ONLY menu item, would be a food unit            called the "patty," consisting of -- this would be guaranteed in                 writing -- "100 percent animal matter of some kind."

Miss Manners also believes that the sight of            people strolling hand in hand or arm in arm or arm in hand dresses up a          city considerably more than the more familiar sight of people shaking            umbrellas at one another.

He apparently fell backward by accident on a dozen salad          forks.  Simultaneously the true heir, his son Carotene, mysteriously             fled the city, complaining of some sort of plot and a lot of                     threatening notes left on his breakfast tray.  At the time, this looked          suspicious what with his father's death, and Carotene was suspected of           foul play.  Then the rest of the King's relatives began to drop dead             one after the other in an odd fashion.  Some were found strangled with           dishrags and some succumbed to food poisoning.  A few were found                 drowned in the soup vats, and one was attacked by assailants unknown             and beaten to death with a pot roast.  At least three appear to have             thrown themselves backward on salad forks, perhaps in a noble gesture            of grief over the King's untimely end.  Finally there was no one left            in Minas Troney who was either eligible or willing to wear the accursed          crown, and the rule of Twodor was up for grabs.  The scullery slave              Parrafin bravely accepted the Stewardship of Twodor until that day when          a lineal descendant of Carotene's returns to reclaim his rightful                throne, conquer Twodor's enemies, and revamp the postal system.                                  -- Harvard Lampoon, "Bored of the Rings"                         3                                                                                The first myth of management is that it exists.

SIMPLE is an acronym for Sheer Idiot's Monopurpose Programming Language          Environment.  This language, developed at the Hanover College for                Technological Misfits, was designed to make it impossible to write code          with errors in it.  The statements are, therefore, confined to BEGIN,            END and STOP.  No matter how you arrange the statements, you can't make          a syntax error.  Programs written in SIMPLE do nothing useful.

Weary SLOBOL programmers often turn to a related (but                  infinitely faster) language, COCAINE.                                            7                                                                                        THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #17: SARTRE                       .                                                                                Named after the late existential philosopher, SARTRE is an extremely             unstructured language.  Statements in SARTRE have no purpose; they just          are.  Thus SARTRE programs are left to define their own functions.               SARTRE programmers tend to be boring and depressed, and are no fun at            parties.                                                                         8                                                                                        THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #18: C-                           .                                                                                This language was named for the grade received by its creator when he            submitted it as a class project in a graduate programming class.  C- is          best described as a "low-level" programming language.  In fact, the              language generally requires more C- statements than machine-code                 statements to execute a given task.  In this respect, it is very                 similar to COBOL.                                                                13                                                                                       THE LESSER-KNOWN PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES #18: FIFTH                        .                                                                                FIFTH is a precision mathematical language in which the data types               refer to quantity.  The data types range from CC, OUNCE, SHOT, and               JIGGER to FIFTH (hence the name of the language), LITER, MAGNUM and              BLOTTO.  Commands refer to ingredients such as CHABLIS, CHARDONNAY,              CABERNET, GIN, VERMOUTH, VODKA, SCOTCH, and WHATEVERSAROUND.                     .                                                                                The many versions of the FIFTH language reflect the sophistication and           financial status of its users.  Commands in the ELITE dialect include            VSOP and LAFITE, while commands in the GUTTER dialect include HOOTCH             and RIPPLE. The latter is a favorite of frustrated FORTH programmers             who end up using this language.                                                  2                                                                                The light at the end of the tunnel is the headlight of an approaching            train.                                                                           1                                                                                The light at the end of the tunnel may be an oncoming dragon.                    3                                                                                The lion and the calf shall lie down together but the calf won't get             much sleep.                                                                                      -- Woody Allen                                                   2                                                                                The longer I am out of office, the more infallible I appear to myself.                           -- Henry Kissinger                                               3                                                                                "The Lord gave us farmers two strong hands so we could grab as much as           we could with both of them."                                                                     -- Joseph Heller, "Catch-22"                                     4                                                                                The man who follows the crowd will usually get no further than the               crowd.

Indeed, the Russians' predisposition for quiet             reflection followed by sudden preventive action explains why they led            the field for many years in both chess and ax murders.  It is well               known that as early as 1970, the U.S.S.R., aware of what a defeat at             Reykjavik would do to national prestige, implemented a vigorous program          of preparation and incentive.  Every day for an entire year, a team of           psychologists, chess analysts and coaches met with the top three                 Russian grand masters and threatened them with a pointy stick.  That             these tactics proved fruitless is now a part of chess history and a              further testament to the American way, which provides that if you want           something badly enough, you can always go to Iceland and get it from             the Russians.                                                                                    -- Marshall Brickman, Playboy, April, 1973                       16                                                                                               The STAR WARS Song                                                       Sung to the tune of "Lola", by the Kinks:                                .

Our                authority is Isaiah 30:26, "Moreover, the light of the Moon shall be as          the light of the Sun and the light of the Sun shall be sevenfold, as             the light of seven days."  Thus Heaven receives from the Moon as much            radiation as we do from the Sun, and in addition 7*7 (49) times as much          as the Earth does from the Sun, or 50 times in all.  The light we                receive from the Moon is one 1/10,000 of the light we receive from the           Sun, so we can ignore that ... The radiation falling on Heaven will              heat it to the point where the heat lost by radiation is just equal to           the heat received by radiation, i.e., Heaven loses 50 times as much              heat as the Earth by radiation.  Using the Stefan-Boltzmann law for              radiation, (_^HH/_^HE)^4 = 50, where _^HE is the absolute temperature of the     earth (-300K), gives _^HH as 798K (525C).  The exact temperature of Hell         cannot be computed ... [However] Revelations 21:8 says "But the                  fearful, and unbelieving ... shall have their part in the lake which             burneth with fire and brimstone."  A lake of molten brimstone means              that its temperature must be at or below the boiling point, 444.6C.  We          have, then, that Heaven, at 525C is hotter than Hell at 445C.                                    -- From "Applied Optics" vol. 11, A14, 1972                      4                                                                                The Third Law of Photography:                                                            If you did manage to get any good shots, they will be ruined                     when someone inadvertently opens the darkroom door and all of                    the dark leaks out.                                                      6                                                                                The Three Laws of Thermodynamics:                                                .

Unfortunately, it was a one-man life-raft, and quickly sinking, so they          started debating who should be allowed to stay.                                  .

Then Mayor Daley          said, "Look!  We're not solving anything like this!  The only fair               thing to do is to vote on it."  So they did, and Mayor Daley won by 97           votes.                                                                           5                                                                                There was a young lady from Hyde                                                 Who ate a green apple and died.

What this means for you, the                consumer, is that the airlines are no longer required to follow any              rules whatsoever.  They can show snuff movies.  They can charge for              oxygen.  They can hire pilots right out of Vending Machine Refill                Person School.  They can conserve fuel by ejecting husky passengers              over water.  They can ram competing planes in mid-air.  These                    innovations have resulted in tremendous cost savings which have been             passed along to you, the consumer, in the form of flights with                   amazingly low fares, such as $29.  Of course, certain restrictions do            apply, the main one being that all these flights take you to Newark,             and you must pay thousands of dollars if you want to fly back out.                               -- Dave Barry, "Iowa -- Land of Secure Vacations"                1                                                                                This is an unauthorized cybernetic announcement.                                 5                                                                                This is for all ill-treated fellows                                                      Unborn and unbegot,                                                      For them to read when they're in trouble                                                 And I am not.                                                                            -- A.

Many          solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were                largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper,             which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of            paper that were unhappy.                                                                         -- Douglas Adams                                                 7                                                                                This quote is taken from the Diamondback, the University of Maryland             student newspaper, of Tuesday, 3/10/87.                                          .                                                                                        One disadvantage of the Univac system is that it does not use                    Unix, a recently developed program which translates from one                     computer language to another and has a built-in editing system                   which identifies errors in the original program.                         2                                                                                This sentence contradicts itself -- no actually it doesn't.                                      -- Hofstadter                                                    12                                                                               ... This striving for excellence extends into people's personal lives            as well.  When '80s people buy something, they buy the best one, as              determined by (1) price and (2) lack of availability.  Eighties people           buy imported dental floss.  They buy gourmet baking soda.  If an '80s            couple goes to a restaurant where they have made a reservation three             weeks in advance, and they are informed that their table is available,           they stalk out immediately, because they know it is not an excellent             restaurant.  If it were, it would have an enormous crowd of                      excellence-oriented people like themselves waiting, their beepers going          off like crickets in the night.  An excellent restaurant wouldn't have           a table ready immediately for anybody below the rank of Liza Minnelli.                           -- Dave Barry, "In Search of Excellence"                         2                                                                                This will be a memorable month -- no matter how hard you try to forget           it.                                                                              18                                                                                       Thompson, if he is to be believed, has sampled the entire                rainbow of legal and illegal drugs in heroic efforts to feel better              than he does.                                                                            As for the truth about his health: I have asked around about             it.  I am told that he appears to be strong and rosy, and steadily               sane.  But we will be doing what he wants us to do, I think, if we               consider his exterior a sort of Dorian Gray facade.  Inwardly, he is             being eaten alive by tinhorn politicians.                                                The disease is fatal.  There is no known cure.  The most we can          do for the poor devil, it seems to me, is to name his disease in his             honor.  From this moment on, let all those who feel that Americans can           be as easily led to beauty as to ugliness, to truth as to public                 relations, to joy as to bitterness, be said to be suffering from Hunter          Thompson's disease.  I don't have it this morning.  It comes and goes.           This morning I don't have Hunter Thompson's disease.                                             -- Kurt Vonnegut Jr. on Dr. Hunter S.

Another symptom is that you cease brushing your teeth, because (a) your          teeth hurt, and (b) you lack the strength.  Midway through the brushing          process, you'd have to lie down in front of the sink to rest for a               couple of hours, and rivulets of toothpaste foam would dribble sideways          out of your mouth, eventually hardening into crusty little toothpaste            stalagmites that would bond your head permanently to the bathroom                floor, which is how the police would find you.                                   .

Millions of years ago          people did not have them, and home projects were extremely difficult.            For example, when a primitive person wanted to put up paneling, he had           to drive the little paneling nails into the cave wall with his bare              fist, so generally the paneling wound up getting spattered with                  primitive blood, which isn't really all that bad when you consider how           ugly paneling is to begin with.                                                                  -- Dave Barry, "The Taming of the Screw"                         2                                                                                We really don't have any enemies.

I could not tell the girl about the woman of the tollway, of             her milk white BMW and her Jordache smile.  There had been a fight.  I           had punched her boyfriend, who fought the mechanical bulls.  Everyone            told him, "You ride the bull, senor.  You do not fight it."  But he was          lean and tough like a bad rib-eye and he fought the bull.  And then he           fought me.  And when we finished there were no winners, just men doing           what men must do. ...                                                                    "Stop the car," the girl said.

I started to speak, but she raised an arm and spoke with a             quiet and peace I will never forget.

Remember to never split an infinitive.  The passive voice should never           be used.  Do not put statements in the negative form.  Verbs have to             agree with their subjects.  Proofread carefully to see if you words              out.  If you reread your work, you can find on rereading a great deal            of repetition can be avoided by rereading and editing.  A writer must            not shift your point of view.  And don't start a sentence with a                 conjunction.  (Remember, too, a preposition is a terrible word to end a          sentence with.)  Don't overuse exclamation marks!!  Place pronouns as            close as possible, especially in long sentences, as of 10 or more                words, to their antecedents.  Writing carefully, dangling participles            must be avoided.  If any word is improper at the end of a sentence, a            linking verb is.  Take the bull by the hand and avoid mixing                     metaphors.  Avoid trendy locutions that sound flaky.  Everyone should            be careful to use a singular pronoun with singular nouns in their                writing.  Always pick on the correct idiom.  The adverb always follows           the verb.

Suddenly, lightning struck a nearby log and set it on fire.  One of the          cavemen stared at the fire for a few minutes, then said: "Hey!  Wood             heat!"

This is called a "circuit".  The most common home           electrical problem is when the circuit is broken by a "circuit                   breaker"; this causes the electricity to back up in one of the wires             until it bursts out of an outlet in the form of sparks, which can                damage your carpet.  The best way to avoid broken circuits is to change          your fuses regularly.                                                                    Another common problem is that the lights flicker.  This                 sometimes means that your electrical system is inadequate, but more              often it means that your home is possessed by demons, in which case              you'll need to get a caulking gun and some caulking.  If you're not              sure whether your house is possessed, see "The Amityville Horror", a             fine documentary film based on an actual book.  Or call in a licensed            electrician, who is trained to spot the signs of demonic possession,             such as blood coming down the stairs, enormous cats on the dinette               table, etc.                                                                                      -- Dave Barry, "The Taming of the Screw"                         1                                                                                Your life would be very empty if you had nothing to regret.                      1                                                                                Your lucky color has faded.                                                      1                                                                                Your lucky number has been disconnected.                                         1                                                                                Your lucky number is 3552664958674928.
